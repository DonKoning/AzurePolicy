# Azure Policy Remediation

# Introduction

Unfortunaltely, Azure Policy currently doesn't support auto-remediation of non-compliant resources. When working with Azure policy you'll regularly find yourself in a situation where you need to run manual remediation tasks to bring non-compliant resources back to a compliant state. 

To automate these tasks, I've created a sample pipeline and scripts that can be used to automate your policy remediation efforts.
